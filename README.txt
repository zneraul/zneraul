Welcome to my portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as an aspiring programmer and IT student. The website is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, providing visitors with an insight into my work and capabilities.

My website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring it works seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes. I have implemented smooth scrolling for a better user experience and included interactive elements like hover effects and animations to engage users. Additionally, the site features a project showcase or proposals that displays various projects with descriptions.

To create this website I used HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Additionaly also used Font Awesome and Google Fonts for both icons and typography.

The website is designed to be user-friendly. You can easily navigate through different sections using the navigation bar at the top. Each section offers insights into my skills, projects, and background.

On the **Home** page, you'll find a brief introduction. The **Skills and Expertise** section showcases my skills with progress indicators. In the **Projects** section, there's a gallery of my projects with descriptions and the technologies used. The **About Me** section provides information about my background and interests. Finally, the **Contact** section includes a form to get in touch with me.

For my portfolio, I've chosen to focus on Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being. This goal is all about ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for everyone, no matter their age. My projects show my dedication to health innovation and technology, and how I'm contributing to this important global goal.
